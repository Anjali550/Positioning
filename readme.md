## **What is Position in Css?**

The position property is used to manipulate the location of an element. it is used to specify where an element is displayed on the page. We use **top**, **right**, **bottom** and **left** properties to determine the final location of the element.

## Types of Position:-

1. Static Position
    
2. Relative Position
    
3. Fixed Position
    
4. Absolute Position
    
5. Sticky Position
    

### 1\. Static position:-

Static Position is the default type of positioning which is applied to every component inside the document.

We can not use left, right, top, bottom and z-index properties in this type of positioning.

In this positioning, HTML elements behave as they should in the normal flow of document.



## 2.Relative position:-

in simple words, it is relative to its normal position and will leave a gap in its normal position. It is used when we need to position an HTML element relative to its normal position. We can set the top, right, bottom, and left properties that will cause the element to adjust away from the normal position





## 3\. Absolute position:-

An element with the absolute position will move according to the position of its parent element.

One of the most interesting properties is that the flow of the web page is not maintained in absolute positioning but focuses on the use of space


## 4\. Fixed position:-

In fixed Position HTML element is remove from the normal flow of the document. Its position is adjusted by left, right, top, and bottom properties. It is positioned relative to the initial containing block established by the viewport.

it is relative to the browser window. it is used when we want to keep an HTML element at a fixed spot no matter where on the page the user is.



## 5.Sticky position:-

In sticky positions the element relative to the users scroll position and sticky position is the combination of the relative and fixed.

Behave similarly to relative positioning, maintained the flow or order of the webpage and not focus on space and follow the fixed property as well, which is not scrollable.
